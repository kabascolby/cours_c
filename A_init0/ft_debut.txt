1. In the most concise way possible, answer this question, what is 42? How would
you describe 42 to someone who doesn’t know what 42 is?

the way I used to describe 42 when I meet meet people about 42. I told them
42 is a tuition-free p2p learning environment verry unique and amazing. Because
you learn in few time what you suppose to learn in other regular school in one 
year or more. With 42, programming become clear as a water.

2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

There are no instructions on the 42 logic tests because its checking how you
solve problem by yourself. Most of the problem have many solutions. Students 
usually give the same solution of their teacher. But if you find the solution
yourself you will in any situation you will find a way to fix it. 42 help you
break the barrier of impossible to possible.

3. What are the core 42 principles?
Be a person who will give back as much as you get from the community. Be peace
and respectfull. Eat code drink code and sleep code.

4. If somebody is thinking of going to 42, but has no coding experience - do you
really think it’s worth their time?

Of course! As I've stated above, 42 is about so much more than coding. To be honest
it litle bit difficult for the beginner but if you focus you can do it. Difficul 
doesn’t mean impossible you just have to work hard.


5. What makes 42 unique?
Everithing. We are a community of self driven programmers. 42 is tuition free. Our p2p
learning environment and gamified project structure.

6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

Dealing with time creep and interpersonal skills. It's important to be unafraid
to ask questions and admit when you don't know something. team work. Sahring knoledge.
Being able to explain your work to someone who knows less It's equally as important to
be able to defend your work against those who know more than you, and learn how you
can improve.

7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the
problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

Check to see if there is a man page, try to solve the problem with that or ask google
or friends.

8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high on a
daily basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine pressure
and strict deadlines?

Manage your time. avoid to many distraction be surronding with the student who progress,
have a life balance is very important. Eating well, sleeping well, and set your goals.

9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website, 
but they do not offer job placement, what would you say?

42 provides us with the tools to get a job, having a job depends on your skills and that
not depends on 42.

10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a 
certain level before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime 
you find one?

Previously, it was required that a cadet be level seven and have completed
a branch of the inner circle. My current understanding is that the first and the second
internships is no longer a requirement.

42 teaches you impliment the good habits, to respect the deadlines, dealing with every body,
and how to be verry professional.
