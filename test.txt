I read this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23235910/variadic-unused-function-macro
and other  articles about how to void unused arguments or variables
the solution was about 10 lines. I came up with this solution:
#define UNUSED(x, ...) (void)((void)x, ##__VA_ARGS__)
ex:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int e;
    char **a;
	char *c;
    UNUSED(argc, argv, e, a, c);

    return 0;
}

maybe someone have better solution...
